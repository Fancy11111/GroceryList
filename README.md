# GroceryList

Just a quick little grocery list app in Angular, done for a school assignement

## Task

This school assignement has to be done with angular.
The elements and functionalities were assigned and can not be changed.
We have to use deployd as a 'backend' with specific configs that could not be changed either.
For anyone wanting to try this on their own PC, you have to either:
* Run deployd with a collection called 'einkaufsliste'
* Or switch the url making the calls in the service to another API that stores and provides data.

The fields of either of those two things have to be (name: type):
* id: string
* produkt: string   // produkt == product
* kosten: number    // kosten == costs
* erledigt: number  // erledigt == done

If you want to change the name of those fields, you'll have to do a lot of refactoring.

## Technologies used
We have to use Angular, so obviously this project is based on Angular
I also added in  [Materialize](http://materializecss.com), a [Material Design](https://material.io/guidelines/) based front-end framework
